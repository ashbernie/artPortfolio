    <h1> Allow Me To Introduce Myself </h1>
    <h4> My Story </h4>
    <p> Welcome to my site! My name is Ashton Jacobs. I am a Jersey boy at heart, but I have been living in Charlotte, NC longer than I have lived in New Jersey now. I am a man with many talents and not enough time to pursue them all, but it doesn't stop me from trying!
      My passion for creating began as a child and as I got older my creativity grew. I have experience with designing objects in AUTOCAD, and rhino. I also have experience creating models/designs out of foamboard! My passion for creation has always been heavily based on the construction industry but I continued to learn and develop different skills.
      In my portfolio you will see photographs taken by none other than myself, and the dog treat brand "Storm and Bear Treat Co." is my business partner's and I's all natural dog treat company that I developed the logo packaging and treat recipes for. The bandana company - The Dutch Dog Co. is another small business venture I do as a hobby because I recently started sewing and became rather good at it. 
      I first illustrated the sewing pattern that I was going to create and I am currently working on printing a 3D cutting template to make my life easier and make the sewing process even more efficient. In my time, I have built furniture, designed a 2D platformer game, currently working on another 2D game and I am honing in on my skills as a designer and computer programmer. 
      Creativity flows throuhout my body just as blood runs through my veins. Without a way to creatively express myself I would be nothing and this job has reignited a passion that I thought had disappeared. If given the opportunity to learn and grow from the Parson's Team, you would not regret your decision. I am hungry to learn, grow and experience new things and this role would allow me to wear multiple hats and most importantly it would allow me to create. 
      Thank you for the opportunity to interview! I apologize for the plainess of the site, but I wanted a way to share my art without it being an email attachment or a layout on InDesign, I hope you guys enjoy!
    </p>
